A **discrete probability space** is a [probability_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/probability_space/) with a [countable](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/countable/) sample space.

## Definition

Let $\Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots\}$ be a [countable](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/countable/) set and $(p_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) of real numbers $p_n \in [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} p_n = 1$.

The triplet $(\Omega, \mathcal{P}(\Omega), \mathbb{P})$ is a *discrete probability space*, where:

- $\Omega$ is the sample space
- $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ is the power set (all subsets of $\Omega$)
- $\mathbb{P}$ is the [discrete_probability_measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/discrete_probability_measure/) defined by $\mathbb{P}(A) = \sum_{n: \omega_n \in A} p_n$

## Examples

- **Fair coin flip**: $\Omega = \{H, T\}$, $p_H = p_T = \frac{1}{2}$
- **Fair die roll**: $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, $p_i = \frac{1}{6}$
- **Geometric distribution**: $\Omega = \mathbb{N}$, $p_n = (1-p)^{n-1}p$
