A **stochastic process** is a collection of random variables indexed by time or another parameter, representing the evolution of a random system.

## Definition

A stochastic process is a family of random variables $\{X_t\}_{t \in T}$ defined on a [probability_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/probability_space/) $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$, where:

- $T$ is the [index set](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/index_set/) (often representing time)
- Each $X_t : \Omega \to S$ maps outcomes to a state space $S$

## Classification

### By Index Set $T$

- **Discrete-time**: $T = \mathbb{N}$ or $T = \mathbb{Z}$ (e.g., random walks)
- **Continuous-time**: $T = [0, \infty)$ or $T = \mathbb{R}$ (e.g., Brownian motion)

### By State Space $S$

- **Discrete state space**: $S$ is [countable](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/countable/) (e.g., Markov chains)
- **Continuous state space**: $S = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{R}^n$ (e.g., diffusion processes)

## Examples

- Random walks
- Markov chains
- Brownian motion (Wiener process)
- Poisson processes
- Martingales
