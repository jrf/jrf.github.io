The **Koch snowflake** (also called the Koch curve or Koch star) is a fractal curve constructed by recursively adding triangular bumps to a line segment.

## Construction

1. Start with an equilateral triangle $K_0$ of side length 1
2. Replace the middle third of each edge with two sides of an equilateral triangle (pointing outward)
3. Repeat step 2 for each edge of the resulting polygon

This produces a sequence of curves $K_0, K_1, K_2, \ldots$ converging to the Koch snowflake $K_\infty$.

## Perimeter

Each iteration multiplies the number of segments by 4 and the length of each segment by $1/3$:



$$
\text{Perimeter}(K_n) = 3 \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^n
$$



As $n \to \infty$:



$$
\text{Perimeter}(K_\infty) = \lim_{n \to \infty} 3 \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^n = \infty
$$



## Area

The area converges to a finite value:



$$
\text{Area}(K_\infty) = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{5}
$$



(for initial triangle with side length 1)

## Fractal Dimension

The Koch snowflake has Hausdorff dimension:



$$
d = \frac{\log 4}{\log 3} \approx 1.26186
$$



This reflects that it is "more than" a 1-dimensional curve but "less than" a 2-dimensional surface.

## Properties

- Infinite perimeter enclosing finite area
- Self-similar: each edge is a scaled copy of the whole boundary
- Continuous but nowhere differentiable
