# Probability_space

## Definition

A *probability space* $\left. \left( \Omega,\mathcal{F},P \right) \right.$ is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a stochastic_process. It consists of three elements:

1.  $\Omega$: A sample space or set of all possible outcomes.

2.  $\mathcal{F}$: A set of events (also a $\sigma$-algebra) where an event is a set of outcomes in the sample space $\Omega$.

3.  $P$: A [probability_measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/probability_measure/) and a [set_function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/set_function/) which assigns a probability to each event in $\mathcal{F}$, i.e. $P:\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \left. \lbrack 0,1\rbrack \right.$.
