# Measurable_Space

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and $\mathcal{A}$ be a [sigma-algebra](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/sigma-algebra/) on $X$. The pair $\left. \left( X,\mathcal{A} \right) \right.$ is called a *measurable space*. If $\mu$ is a [measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/measure/) on $X$, then $\left. \left( X,\mathcal{A},\mu \right) \right.$ is called a *[measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/measure/) space*.
