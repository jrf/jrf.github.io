# Compactness

## Definition

A set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is *compact* if every [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) in $K$ has a [subsequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/subsequence/) that converges to a [limit](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/limit/) that is also in $K$.
