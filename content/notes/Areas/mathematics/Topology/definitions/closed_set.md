# Closed_set

## Definition

A set $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is *closed* if it contains its [limit_point](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/limit_point/)s.

The adjective "closed" appears in several other mathematical contexts and is usually employed to mean that an operation on the elements of a given set does not take us out of the set. In linear algebra, for example, a [vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/vector_space/) is a set that is "closed" under addition and scalar multiplication. In analysis, the operation we are concerned with is the limiting operation. Topologically speaking, a *closed set* is one where convergent [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/)s within the set have limits that are also in the set.

## Theorems

### (i)

The union of a finite collection of closed sets is closed.

### (ii)

The intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is closed
