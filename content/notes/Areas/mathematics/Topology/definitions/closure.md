# Closure

## Definition

Given a [set](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/set/) $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $L$ be the [set](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/set/) of all [limit_point](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/limit_point/)s of $A$. The *closure* of $A$ is defined to be $\overline{A} = A \cup L$.

## Theorems

**Theorem**: For any $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, the closure $\overline{A}$ is a [closed_set](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/closed_set/) and is the smallest [closed_set](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/closed_set/) containing $A$.
