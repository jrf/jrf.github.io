# Closure

> [Definition]{.underline}: Given a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, let $L$ be the set of all [limit_point](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/limit_point/)s of $A$. The [[[closure]{.underline}]] of $A$ is defined to be $\overline{A} = A \cup L$.

## Theorems

> [Theorem]{.underline}: For any $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, the closure $\overline{A}$ is a [closed_set](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/closed_set/) and is the smallest [closed_set](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/closed_set/) containing $A$.
