## Definition

A **topological space** is an ordered pair $(X, \tau)$ where $X$ is a set and $\tau \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ (called **[open sets](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/open_set/)**) satisfying:

1. $\emptyset \in \tau$ and $X \in \tau$
2. $\tau$ is closed under arbitrary unions: if $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A} \subseteq \tau$, then $\bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha \in \tau$
3. $\tau$ is closed under finite intersections: if $U_1, \dots, U_n \in \tau$, then $\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \in \tau$

The collection $\tau$ is called a **topology** on $X$.

## Examples

- **Discrete topology**: $\tau = \mathcal{P}(X)$ — every [subset](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/subset/) is open
- **Indiscrete topology**: $\tau = \{\emptyset, X\}$ — only the empty set and $X$ are open
- **[Metric](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/metric/) topology**: the topology induced by a [metric](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/metric/), where open sets are unions of open balls

## Related Concepts

- [Metric Space](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/metric_space/) — every [metric space](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/metric_space/) induces a topological space
- [Metric](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/metric/) — a distance function that generates a topology
- [Continuity](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/continuity/) — defined via preimages of open sets
