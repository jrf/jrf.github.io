**Aleph null** (or **aleph naught**), denoted $\aleph_0$, is the [cardinality](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/cardinality/) of the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$.

## Definition



$$
\aleph_0 = |\mathbb{N}| = |\mathbb{Z}| = |\mathbb{Q}|
$$



A set has cardinality $\aleph_0$ if and only if it is [countably infinite](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/countable/)—that is, its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbb{N}$.

## Properties

- $\aleph_0$ is the smallest infinite cardinal
- $\aleph_0 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0$
- $\aleph_0 \cdot \aleph_0 = \aleph_0$
- $2^{\aleph_0} = |\mathbb{R}| = \mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum)

## Examples of Sets with Cardinality $\aleph_0$

- Natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$
- Integers $\mathbb{Z}$
- Rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$
- Algebraic numbers
- Any infinite subset of a countable set
