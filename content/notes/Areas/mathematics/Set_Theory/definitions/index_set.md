An **index set** is a set whose elements are used to label or index the members of another collection.

## Definition

Let $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a family of sets. The set $I$ is called the *index set*, and each $i \in I$ is called an *index*. The sets $A_i$ are said to be *indexed by* $I$.

## Examples

1. **Finite index set**: $\{A_1, A_2, A_3\}$ is indexed by $I = \{1, 2, 3\}$

2. **[Countable](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/countable/) index set**: A [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is indexed by $I = \mathbb{N}$

3. **Uncountable index set**: The collection of all open intervals $\{(a, b) : a, b \in \mathbb{R}, a < b\}$ can be indexed by $I = \{(a,b) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : a < b\}$

## Usage

Index sets appear throughout mathematics when dealing with:

- Indexed families of sets: $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$
- Arbitrary unions: $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$
- Arbitrary intersections: $\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i$
- Sequences and nets
- Product spaces: $\prod_{i \in I} X_i$
