A **subset** is a [set](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/set/) whose elements are all contained in another set.

## Definition

A set $A$ is a *subset* of a set $B$, written $A \subseteq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$:



$$
A \subseteq B \iff (\forall x)(x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B)
$$



## Proper Subset

$A$ is a *proper subset* of $B$, written $A \subset B$ or $A \subsetneq B$, if $A \subseteq B$ and $A \neq B$.

## Properties

- Every set is a subset of itself: $A \subseteq A$
- The empty set is a subset of every set: $\emptyset \subseteq A$
- If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$, then $A = B$
- If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$, then $A \subseteq C$ (transitivity)

## Power Set

The *power set* $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is the set of all subsets of $A$:



$$
\mathcal{P}(A) = \{B : B \subseteq A\}
$$



If $|A| = n$, then $|\mathcal{P}(A)| = 2^n$.
