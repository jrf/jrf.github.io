# Preimage

## Definition

Let $f$ be a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) from $X$ to $Y$. The *preimage* of a set $B \subseteq Y$ under $f$, denoted by $f^{- 1}\left. (B) \right.$ is the [subset](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/subset/) of $X$ defined by



$$
f^{- 1}\left. (B) \right. = \{ x \in X:f\left. (x) \right. \in B\}
$$



## Examples

For the [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) $f\left. (x) \right. = x^{2}$, the *preimage* of $\{ 4\}$ would be $\{ - 2,2\}$.
