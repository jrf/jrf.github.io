A **map** (or **mapping**) is another term for a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) between sets.

## Definition

A map $f: X \to Y$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x \in X$ exactly one element $f(x) \in Y$.

- $X$ is the [domain](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/domain/)
- $Y$ is the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/codomain/)
- $f(X) = \{f(x) : x \in X\}$ is the [image](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/image/) (or range)

## Terminology

The terms "map," "mapping," and "[function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/)" are often used interchangeably. Some conventions:

- **Map/Mapping**: Often preferred in algebra and topology
- **Function**: Often preferred in analysis
- **Morphism**: Used in category theory for structure-preserving maps

## Types of Maps

- [injection](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/injection/) (one-to-one): $f(x_1) = f(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2$
- [surjection](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/surjection/) (onto): $f(X) = Y$
- [bijection](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/bijection/) (one-to-one and onto): both injective and surjective
