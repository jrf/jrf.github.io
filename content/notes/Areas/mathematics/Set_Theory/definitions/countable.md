# Countable

## Definition

A set $A$ is *countable* if $\mathbb{N} \sim A$. An infinite set that is not *countable* is called an *uncountable* set. (Abbott)

A set $X$ is *countable* if $\# X \leq \#\mathbb{N}$. If $\#\mathbb{N} < \# X$, the set $X$ is said to be *uncountable*. The [cardinality](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/cardinality/) of $\mathbb{N}$ is called $\aleph_{0}$, [aleph_null](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/aleph_null/) (Schilling).
