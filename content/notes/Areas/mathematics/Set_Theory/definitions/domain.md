# Domain

## Definition

The domain of a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) is the set into which all of the input of the [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) is constrained to fall. It is the set $X$ in the notation $f:X \rightarrow Y$, and is alternatively denoted as $\text{dom }\left. (f) \right.$.

The above graphic shows a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) $f$ from $X$ to $Y$. The blue oval $Y$ is the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/codomain/) of $f$. The red oval $X$ is the [domain](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/domain/) of $f$. The blue oval $Y$ is the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/codomain/) of $f$. The yellow oval inside $Y$ is the [image](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/image/) of $f$.
