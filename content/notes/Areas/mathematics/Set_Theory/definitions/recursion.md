**Recursion** is a method of defining objects or processes in terms of themselves, typically by specifying a base case and a rule for building new instances from existing ones.

## Recursive Definitions

A *recursive definition* consists of:

1. **Base case(s)**: Explicitly defined initial value(s)
2. **Recursive step**: A rule defining new values in terms of previously defined values

## Examples

### Factorial



$$
n! = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n = 0 \\ n \cdot (n-1)! & \text{if } n > 0 \end{cases}
$$



### Fibonacci Sequence



$$
F_n = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } n = 0 \\ 1 & \text{if } n = 1 \\ F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} & \text{if } n > 1 \end{cases}
$$



### Recursive Set Construction

The [Cantor_set](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/cantor_set/) is defined recursively:
- $C_0 = [0, 1]$
- $C_{n+1}$ is obtained by removing the open middle third of each interval in $C_n$
- $C = \bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty} C_n$

## Principle of Recursion

The validity of recursive definitions on $\mathbb{N}$ is guaranteed by the *Recursion Theorem*, which follows from the Peano axioms and the well-ordering of the natural numbers.
