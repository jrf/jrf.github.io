# Cauchy Criterion for Uniform Convergence

## Theorem

A [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) of [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/)s $\left. \left( f_{n} \right) \right.$ defined on a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ *converges uniformly* on $A$ *if and only if* for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\left| f_{n}\left. (x) \right. - f_{m}\left. (x) \right. \right| < \epsilon$ whenever $m,n \geq N$ and $x \in A$.

Proof: See Exercise 6.2.5 in Abbott.
