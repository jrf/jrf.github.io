## Definition

Two sets $A$ and $B$ are *disjoint* if their intersection is empty:



$$
A \cap B = \emptyset
$$



A collection of sets $\{A_i : i \in I\}$ is *[pairwise disjoint](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/pairwise_disjoint/)* if $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$.
