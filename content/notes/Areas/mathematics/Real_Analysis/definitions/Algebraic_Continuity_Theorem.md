# [Algebraic_Continuity_Theorem](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/algebraic_continuity_theorem/) {#definition}

Assume $f:A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g:A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are continuous at a point $c \in A$. Then,

1.  $kf\left. (x) \right.$ is continuous at $c$ for all $k \in \mathbb{R}$.

2.  $f\left. (x) \right. + g\left. (x) \right.$ is continuous at $c$.

3.  $f\left. (x) \right.g\left. (x) \right.$ is continuous at $c$.

4.  $f\left. (x) \right./g\left. (x) \right.$ is continuous at $c$, provided the quotient is defined.

Proof:
