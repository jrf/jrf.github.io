## Definition

A set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is [compact](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/compactness/) if and only if it is closed and bounded.

## Proof

($\Rightarrow$) Assume $K$ is compact.

*Bounded:* The open cover $\{(-n, n) : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ covers $K$. By [compactness](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/compactness/), a finite subcover exists, so $K \subseteq (-N, N)$ for some $N$.

*Closed:* Let $x$ be a [limit point](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/limit_point/) of $K$. For each $n$, there exists $x_n \in K$ with $|x_n - x| < 1/n$. The [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) $(x_n)$ has a convergent [subsequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/subsequence/) (by [compactness](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/compactness/)) converging to some $y \in K$. But $(x_n) \to x$, so $x = y \in K$.

($\Leftarrow$) Assume $K$ is closed and bounded. Let $(x_n)$ be a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) in $K$. By [Bolzano-Weierstrass_Theorem](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/bolzano-weierstrass_theorem/), $(x_n)$ has a convergent [subsequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/subsequence/). Since $K$ is closed, the limit is in $K$. Thus $K$ is compact.
