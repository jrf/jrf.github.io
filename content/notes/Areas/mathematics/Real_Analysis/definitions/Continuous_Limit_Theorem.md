# Continuous Limit Theorem

## Theorem

Let $\left. \left( f_{n} \right) \right.$ be a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) of [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/)s defined on $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that converges uniformly on $A$ to a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) $f$. If each $f_{n}$ is continuous at $c \in A$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$.

Proof: See page 179 of [Understanding_Analysis](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/books/understanding_analysis/).
