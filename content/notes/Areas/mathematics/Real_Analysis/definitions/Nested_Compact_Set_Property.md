## Definition

If $K_1 \supseteq K_2 \supseteq K_3 \supseteq \cdots$ is a nested [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) of nonempty [compact](/notes/areas/mathematics/topology/definitions/compactness/) sets, then the intersection $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} K_n$ is nonempty.

## Proof

For each $n$, choose $x_n \in K_n$. Since $x_n \in K_1$ for all $n$ and $K_1$ is compact, the [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) $(x_n)$ has a convergent [subsequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/subsequence/) $x_{n_k} \to x$ with $x \in K_1$.

For any fixed $m$, the [subsequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/subsequence/) $(x_{n_k})$ is eventually in $K_m$ (since $n_k \geq m$ implies $x_{n_k} \in K_{n_k} \subseteq K_m$).

Since $K_m$ is closed, $x \in K_m$.

Thus $x \in K_m$ for all $m$, so $x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} K_n$.
