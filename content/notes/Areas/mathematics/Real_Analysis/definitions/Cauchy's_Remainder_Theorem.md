## Definition

Let $f$ be a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) with derivatives of all orders on an interval containing $0$. For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $x$ in this interval, there exists a point $c$ between $0$ and $x$ such that the error function $E_n(x) = f(x) - S_n(x)$ satisfies



$$
E_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{n!}(x-c)^n x
$$



where $S_n(x)$ is the $n$th partial sum of the Taylor series.
