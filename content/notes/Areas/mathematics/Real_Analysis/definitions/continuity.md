# Continuity

## Definition

A [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) $f:A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is *continuous* at a point $c \in A$, for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $|x - c| < \delta$ and (and $x \in A$), it follows that $\left| f\left. (x) \right. - f\left. (c) \right. \right| < \epsilon$.

If $f$ is *continuous* at every point in the [domain](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/domain/) $A$, then we say that $f$ is *continuous* on $A$.
