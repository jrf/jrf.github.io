## Definition

A linear operator $U$ on an [inner product](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/inner_product/) space is **unitary** if it preserves inner products:



$$
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle \quad \text{for all } x, y
$$



Equivalently, $U^* U = U U^* = I$, where $U^*$ is the adjoint (conjugate transpose).

## For Matrices

A complex matrix $U$ is unitary if:



$$
U^\dagger U = U U^\dagger = I
$$



where $U^\dagger = \overline{U^T}$ is the conjugate transpose.

For real matrices, this simplifies to **orthogonal**: $U^T U = I$.

## Properties

Unitary operators preserve:

| Property | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| **Inner products** | $\langle Ux, Uy \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle$ |
| **Norms** | $\|Ux\| = \|x\|$ |
| **Angles** | The angle between vectors is unchanged |
| **[Orthogonality](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/orthogonality/)** | Orthogonal vectors remain orthogonal |

## Intuition

Unitary operators are the "rigid motions" of [inner product](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/inner_product/) spaces:
- **Rotations** are unitary
- **Reflections** are unitary
- **Stretching** is NOT unitary (changes lengths)

They rearrange vectors without distorting the geometry.

## Examples

- Rotation matrices in $\mathbb{R}^n$
- The [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ ([Plancherel theorem](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/plancherel_theorem/))
- Quantum mechanical time evolution operators

## Related Concepts

- [Inner product](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/inner_product/) — what unitary operators preserve
- [Norm](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/norm/) — also preserved by unitary operators
- [Isomorphism](/notes/areas/mathematics/abstract_algebra/definitions/isomorphism/) — unitary operators are isomorphisms of Hilbert spaces
