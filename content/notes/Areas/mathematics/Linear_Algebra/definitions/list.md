# List

## Definition

Suppose $n$ is a non-negative integer. A *list* of length $n$ is an ordered collection of n elements (which might be numbers, other lists, or more abstract entities) separated by commas and surrounded by parentheses. A list of length $n$ looks like this:



$$
\left. \left( x_{1},\ldots,x_{n} \right) \right.
$$



Two lists are equal if and only if they have the same length and the same elements in the same order.
