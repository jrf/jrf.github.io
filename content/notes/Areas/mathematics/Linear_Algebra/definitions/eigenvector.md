An **eigenvector** of a linear transformation is a nonzero vector that changes by only a scalar factor when that transformation is applied.

## Definition

Let $T: V \to V$ be a linear operator on a [vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/vector_space/) $V$. A nonzero vector $v \in V$ is an *eigenvector* of $T$ if there exists a scalar $\lambda$ such that:



$$
T(v) = \lambda v
$$



The scalar $\lambda$ is called the [eigenvalue](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/eigenvalue/) corresponding to $v$.

## Matrix Form

For a square matrix $A$, a nonzero vector $v$ is an eigenvector if:



$$
Av = \lambda v
$$



Equivalently:



$$
(A - \lambda I)v = 0
$$



where $I$ is the identity matrix.

## Properties

- Eigenvectors are only defined up to scalar multiples: if $v$ is an eigenvector, so is $cv$ for any nonzero scalar $c$
- Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are [linearly_independent](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/linearly_independent/)
- The set of all eigenvectors for a given eigenvalue, together with the zero vector, forms a subspace called the *eigenspace*
