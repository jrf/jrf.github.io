# Linearly_independent

## Definition

A [list](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/list/) $v_{1},\ldots,v_{m}$ of vectors $V$ is called *linearly independent* if the only choice of $a_{1},\ldots,a_{m} \in \mathbb{F}$ that makes $a_{1}v_{1} + \cdots + a_{m}v_{m}$ equal 0 is $a_{1} = \cdots = a_{m} = 0$.

The empty [list](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/list/) () is also declared to be *linearly independent*.

## Theorem 2.23 (Axler): Length of linearly independent list $\leq$ length of spanning list

In a [finite-dimensional_vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/finite-dimensional_vector_space/), the length of every [linearly_independent](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/linearly_independent/) [list](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/list/) of vectors is less than or equal to the length of every [span](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/span/)ning [list](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/list/) of vectors.
