# Subspace

## Definition

A subset $U$ of $V$ is called a *subspace* of $V$ if $U$ is also a [vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/vector_space/) (using the same addition and scalar muliplication as on $V$).

## Conditions for a Subspace

A subset $U$ of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ *if and only if* $U$ satisfies the following three conditions:

1.  Additive identity: $0 \in U$

2.  Closed under addition: $u,w \in U$ implies $u + w \in U$

3.  Closed under scalar multiplication: $a \in \mathbb{F}$ and $u \in U$ implies $au \in U$

Proof:
