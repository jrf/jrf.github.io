**Parseval's theorem** (also known as **Rayleigh's energy theorem** in the context of Fourier transforms) states that the total energy of a signal is preserved under the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/).

## One-Dimensional Form

For a function $g(x)$ with [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) $G(f)$:



$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |g(x)|^2 \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |G(f)|^2 \, df
$$



## Two-Dimensional Form

For a function $g(x, y)$ with [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) $G(f_x, f_y)$:



$$
\iint_{-\infty}^{\infty} |g(x, y)|^2 \, dx \, dy = \iint_{-\infty}^{\infty} |G(f_x, f_y)|^2 \, df_x \, df_y
$$



## Physical Interpretation

- The left side represents the **total energy** in the spatial (or time) domain
- The right side represents the **total energy** in the frequency domain
- The theorem guarantees that energy is neither created nor destroyed by the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/)

## Historical Note

The theorem is named after Marc-Antoine Parseval (for [Fourier series](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_series/)) and Lord Rayleigh (for Fourier transforms). In some contexts, "Parseval's theorem" refers specifically to [Fourier series](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_series/) while "Rayleigh's theorem" or "Plancherel's theorem" refers to Fourier transforms.
