## Definition

A *Schwartz space* $\mathcal{S}$ is the function space of all functions whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing. This space has the important property that the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) is an [automorphism](/notes/areas/mathematics/abstract_algebra/definitions/automorphism/) on this space. This property enables one, by duality, to define the [Fourier_transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) for elements in the dual space $\mathcal{S}^{*}$ of $\mathcal{S}$, that is, for [tempered_distribution](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/tempered_distribution/)s. A [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) in the Schwartz space is sometimes called a [Schwartz_function](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/schwartz_function/).
