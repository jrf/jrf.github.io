## Definition

The *Dirac delta function* $\delta(x)$ is a generalized [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) (distribution) defined by its action on test functions. For any [Schwartz_function](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/schwartz_function/) $\varphi$:



$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(x) \varphi(x) \, dx = \varphi(0)
$$



More generally, the delta function centered at $x_0$:



$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(x - x_0) \varphi(x) \, dx = \varphi(x_0)
$$



This is called the *sifting property*.

## Symbolic Properties

While not a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/function/) in the classical sense, $\delta(x)$ is often written symbolically as:



$$
\delta(x) = \begin{cases} +\infty & x = 0 \\ 0 & x \neq 0 \end{cases}
$$



with the normalization:



$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(x) \, dx = 1
$$



## Delta Sequences (Nascent Deltas)

Since the delta function is not a true function, it is often represented as the limit of a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/sequence/) of ordinary functions. A common choice is the Gaussian:



$$
\delta(x) = \lim_{N \to \infty} N e^{-\pi N^2 x^2}
$$



This works because:

1. **Height** = $N$ at $x = 0$
2. **Width** $\propto 1/N$
3. **Area** = 1 for all $N$:



$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} N e^{-\pi N^2 x^2} \, dx = 1
$$



As $N \to \infty$, the Gaussian becomes infinitely tall and infinitely narrow while maintaining unit area—exactly the defining behavior of $\delta(x)$.

The factor of $\pi$ in the exponent is chosen so the integral equals 1 without additional normalization.

Other common delta sequences include:

- **Lorentzian**: $\displaystyle\frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\epsilon}{x^2 + \epsilon^2}$ as $\epsilon \to 0$
- **Sinc**: $\displaystyle\frac{\sin(Nx)}{\pi x}$ as $N \to \infty$

## Properties

1. **Sifting Property**: $\int f(x) \delta(x - x_0) \, dx = f(x_0)$

2. **Scaling**: $\delta(ax) = \frac{1}{|a|} \delta(x)$ for $a \neq 0$

3. **Symmetry**: $\delta(-x) = \delta(x)$

4. **[Fourier_transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/)**: $\mathcal{F}\{\delta(x)\} = 1$ and $\mathcal{F}\{1\} = \delta(\xi)$

5. **[convolution](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/convolution/) Identity**: $f(x) * \delta(x) = f(x)$

## Relation to [Dirac_measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/dirac_measure/)

The Dirac delta function can be viewed as the density of the [Dirac_measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/dirac_measure/) $\delta_0$ with respect to Lebesgue [measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/measure/) (in a distributional sense).
