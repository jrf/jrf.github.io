## Statement

The **Plancherel theorem** states that the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) is a **[unitary](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/unitary_operator/)** **[isomorphism](/notes/areas/mathematics/abstract_algebra/definitions/isomorphism/)** on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ (see [Lp_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/lp_space/)).

This means the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) preserves [inner products](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/inner_product/):



$$
\langle f, g \rangle = \langle \mathcal{F}\{f\}, \mathcal{F}\{g\} \rangle
$$



or explicitly:



$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \overline{g(x)} \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\nu) \overline{G(\nu)} \, d\nu
$$



## Consequences

Since inner products are preserved, so are:

| Property          | Formula                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Norms** (energy) | $\|f\|_2 = \|\mathcal{F}\{f\}\|_2$ |
| **[Orthogonality](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/orthogonality/)** | $\langle f, g \rangle = 0 \Leftrightarrow \langle F, G \rangle = 0$ |
| **Angles**        | The "angle" between functions is unchanged                          |

## Relation to Parseval's Theorem

[Parseval's theorem](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/parseval_theorem/) is the special case where $f = g$:



$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |F(\nu)|^2 \, d\nu
$$



This says **energy is conserved** — the total energy in the spatial domain equals the total energy in the frequency domain.

Plancherel is more general: it says not just energy, but all geometric structure (inner products) is preserved.

## Why This Matters

The Plancherel theorem tells us that $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ in the spatial domain and $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ in the frequency domain are **the same space** — not just containing the same information, but having identical geometric structure.

The [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) is like a rotation: it rearranges the coordinates but doesn't distort the space.

## Technical Note

The [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) is initially defined for $L^1$ functions (where the integral converges absolutely). For $L^2$ functions, it's extended via a limiting process. The Plancherel theorem guarantees this extension is well-defined and unitary.
