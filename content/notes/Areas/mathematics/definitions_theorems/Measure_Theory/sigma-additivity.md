## Definition

A set function $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, \infty]$ is *$\sigma$-additive* (or *countably additive*) if for any sequence $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of pairwise [disjoint](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/disjoint/) sets in $\mathcal{A}$,



$$
\mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_n)
$$



This is one of the defining properties of a [measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/measure_theory/measure/).

$\sigma$-additivity is stronger than finite additivity and is essential for the theory of [measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/measure_theory/measure/)s and integration.
