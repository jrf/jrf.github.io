## Definition

Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a linear operator acting on a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) space. A nonzero [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $\psi$ is called an *eigenfunction* of $\mathcal{L}$ if:



$$
\mathcal{L}\{\psi\} = \lambda \psi
$$



where $\lambda$ is a scalar called the [eigenvalue](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/eigenvalue/) corresponding to $\psi$.

## Remarks

- Eigenfunctions are the infinite-dimensional analog of eigenvectors.
- The set of eigenfunctions corresponding to a given [eigenvalue](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/eigenvalue/) forms a [subspace](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/subspace/) of the [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) space.

## Example: Linear Shift-Invariant Operators

For linear shift-invariant operators, the complex exponentials $e^{j2\pi \bar{f} \cdot \bar{x}}$ are eigenfunctions:



$$
\mathcal{L}\{e^{j2\pi \bar{f}_0 \cdot \bar{x}}\} = H(\bar{f}_0) e^{j2\pi \bar{f}_0 \cdot \bar{x}}
$$



where $H(\bar{f}_0)$ is the [eigenvalue](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/eigenvalue/) (transfer function) associated with frequency $\bar{f}_0$.

This property is why the [Fourier_transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/functional_analysis/fourier_transform/) is useful for analyzing linear shift-invariant systems: the input can be decomposed into eigenfunctions (complex exponentials), each of which passes through the system multiplied only by a complex constant.
