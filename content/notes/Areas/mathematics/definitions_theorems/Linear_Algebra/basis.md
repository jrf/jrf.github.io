# Basis

## Definition

A *basis* of $V$ is a [list](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/list/) of vectors in $V$ that is [linearly_independent](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/linearly_independent/) and [span](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/span/)s $V$.

## Theorem: Criterion for basis

A [list](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/list/) $v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}$ of vectors in $V$ is a basis of $V$ *if and only if* every $v \in V$ can be written uniquely in the form



$$
v = a_{1}v_{1} + \cdots + a_{n}v_{n}
$$



where $a_{1},\ldots,a_{n} \in \mathbb{F}$.

Proof: See Axler, page 40.

## Theorem: Spanning list contains a basis

Every [span](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/span/)ning [list](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/list/) in a [vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/vector_space/) can be reduced to a basis of the [vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/vector_space/).

## Theorem: Basis of [finite-dimensional_vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/finite-dimensional_vector_space/)

Every [finite-dimensional_vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/finite-dimensional_vector_space/) has a basis.

## Theorem: [linearly_independent](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/linearly_independent/) [list](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/list/) extends to a basis

Every [linearly_independent](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/linearly_independent/) [list](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/list/) of vectors in a [finite-dimensional_vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/finite-dimensional_vector_space/) can be extended to a basis of the [vector_space](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/linear_algebra/vector_space/).
