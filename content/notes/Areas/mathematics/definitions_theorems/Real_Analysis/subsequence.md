## Definition

Let $(a_n)$ be a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) of real numbers, and let $n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < \cdots$ be an increasing [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) of natural numbers. Then the [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) $(a_{n_1}, a_{n_2}, a_{n_3}, \ldots)$ is called a *subsequence* of $(a_n)$ and is denoted by $(a_{n_k})$.
