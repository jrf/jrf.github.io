## Definition

Let $g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ be a power series that converges at the point $x = R > 0$. Then the series converges [uniformly](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/uniform_convergence/) on $[0, R]$, and $g$ is [continuous](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/continuity/) on $[0, R]$.

In particular, $\lim_{x \to R^-} g(x) = g(R) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n R^n$.
