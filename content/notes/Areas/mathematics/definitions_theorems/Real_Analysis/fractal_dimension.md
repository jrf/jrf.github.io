## Definition

The *fractal dimension* (or *box-counting dimension*) of a bounded set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as



$$
\dim(A) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{\log N(\epsilon)}{\log(1/\epsilon)}
$$



where $N(\epsilon)$ is the minimum number of $\epsilon$-balls (or boxes of side length $\epsilon$) needed to cover $A$, provided this limit exists.

For example, the [Cantor_set](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/cantor_set/) has fractal dimension $\log 2 / \log 3 \approx 0.631$.
