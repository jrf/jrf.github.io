## Definition

If $\{f_n\}$ is a uniformly bounded and equicontinuous [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) of functions on a [compact](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/topology/compactness/) set $K$, then there exists a [subsequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/subsequence/) $\{f_{n_k}\}$ that converges [uniformly](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/uniform_convergence/) on $K$.

A family of functions is *equicontinuous* if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| < \epsilon$ for all $n$ whenever $|x - y| < \delta$.
