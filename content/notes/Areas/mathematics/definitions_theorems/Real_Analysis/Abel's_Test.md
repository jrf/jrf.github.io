## Definition

Let $(b_n)$ be a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) satisfying $b_1 \geq b_2 \geq b_3 \geq \cdots \geq 0$ with $\lim b_n = 0$. If the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ has bounded partial sums, then the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n b_n$ converges.
