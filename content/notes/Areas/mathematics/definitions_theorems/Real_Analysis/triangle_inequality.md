## Definition

For all $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$,



$$
|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|
$$



More generally, for any finite collection of real numbers,



$$
\left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \right| \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i|
$$



## Proof

We have $-|a| \leq a \leq |a|$ and $-|b| \leq b \leq |b|$.

Adding: $-(|a| + |b|) \leq a + b \leq |a| + |b|$.

This means $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$.

The general case follows by induction.
