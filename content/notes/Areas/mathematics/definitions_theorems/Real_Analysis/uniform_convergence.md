# Uniform_convergence

## Definition

Let $\left. \left( f_{n} \right) \right.$ be a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) of [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/)s defined on a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then, $\left. \left( f_{n} \right) \right.$ *converges uniformly* on $A$ to a limit function $f$ defined on $A$ if, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\left| f_{n}\left. (x) \right. - f\left. (x) \right. \right| < \epsilon$ whenever $n \geq N$ and $x \in A$.

Compare this to the definition of [pointwise_convergence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/pointwise_convergence/).
