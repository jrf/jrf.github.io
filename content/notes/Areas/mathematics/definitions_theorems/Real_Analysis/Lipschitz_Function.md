## Definition

A [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $f:A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called *Lipschitz* if there exists a bound $M > 0$ such that



$$
\left| \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} \right| \leq M
$$



for all $x \neq y \in A$.

Equivalently, $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq M|x - y|$ for all $x, y \in A$.

Geometrically, a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $f$ is Lipschitz if there is a uniform bound on the magnitude of the slopes of lines drawn through any two points on the graph of $f$.

## Proof (Lipschitz implies Uniform Continuity)

If $f$ is Lipschitz with constant $M$, then given $\epsilon > 0$, choose $\delta = \epsilon/M$.

For $|x - y| < \delta$:


$$
|f(x) - f(y)| \leq M|x - y| < M \cdot \frac{\epsilon}{M} = \epsilon
$$



Thus $f$ is [uniformly continuous](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/uniform_continuity/).
