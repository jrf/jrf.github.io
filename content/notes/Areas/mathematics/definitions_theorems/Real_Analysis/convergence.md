# Convergence_of_a_Sequence

## Definition

A [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) $\left. \left( a_{n} \right) \right.$ *converges* to a real number $a$ if, for every positive number $\epsilon$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $n \geq N$, it follows that $\left| a_{n} - a \right| < \epsilon$.
