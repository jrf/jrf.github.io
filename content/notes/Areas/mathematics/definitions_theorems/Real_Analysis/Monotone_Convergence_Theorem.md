## Definition

If a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) is monotone and bounded, then it converges.

More precisely:
- If $(a_n)$ is increasing and bounded above, then $\lim a_n = \sup\{a_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$
- If $(a_n)$ is decreasing and bounded below, then $\lim a_n = \inf\{a_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$

## Proof

Let $(a_n)$ be increasing and bounded above. Let $s = \sup\{a_n\}$, which exists by the [axiom_of_completeness](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/axiom_of_completeness/).

Given $\epsilon > 0$, by the definition of [supremum](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/supremum/), there exists $N$ such that $s - \epsilon < a_N \leq s$.

Since $(a_n)$ is increasing, for all $n \geq N$:


$$
s - \epsilon < a_N \leq a_n \leq s < s + \epsilon
$$



Thus $|a_n - s| < \epsilon$ for $n \geq N$, so $a_n \to s$.
