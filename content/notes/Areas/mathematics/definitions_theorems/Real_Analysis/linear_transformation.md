## Definition

A [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $T: V \to W$ between vector spaces is a *linear transformation* (or *linear map*) if for all vectors $u, v \in V$ and scalars $c$:

1. **Additivity:** $T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)$
2. **Homogeneity:** $T(cv) = cT(v)$

Equivalently, $T(au + bv) = aT(u) + bT(v)$ for all scalars $a, b$ and vectors $u, v$.
