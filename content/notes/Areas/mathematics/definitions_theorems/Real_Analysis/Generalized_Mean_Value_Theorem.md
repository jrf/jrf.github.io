## Definition

If $f$ and $g$ are [continuous](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/continuity/) on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and [differentiable](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/differentiable/) on the open interval $(a,b)$, then there exists a point $c \in (a,b)$ where



$$
[f(b) - f(a)]g'(c) = [g(b) - g(a)]f'(c)
$$



If $g'$ is never zero on $(a,b)$, this can be written as



$$
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}
$$



## Proof

Define $h(x) = [f(b) - f(a)]g(x) - [g(b) - g(a)]f(x)$.

Then $h(a) = f(b)g(a) - f(a)g(a) - g(b)f(a) + g(a)f(a) = f(b)g(a) - g(b)f(a)$

And $h(b) = f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(b) - g(b)f(b) + g(a)f(b) = g(a)f(b) - f(a)g(b) = h(a)$

By Rolle's Theorem, there exists $c \in (a,b)$ with $h'(c) = 0$, giving the result.
