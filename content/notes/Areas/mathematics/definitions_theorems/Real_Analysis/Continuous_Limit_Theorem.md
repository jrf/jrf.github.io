## Theorem

Let $\left. \left( f_{n} \right) \right.$ be a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) of functions defined on $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that converges uniformly on $A$ to a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $f$. If each $f_{n}$ is continuous at $c \in A$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$.

Proof: See page 179 of [Understanding_Analysis](/notes/areas/mathematics/books/understanding_analysis/).
