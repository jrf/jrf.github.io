## Definition

Every bounded [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) contains a convergent [subsequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/subsequence/).

## Proof

Let $(a_n)$ be a bounded [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/). Then there exists $M > 0$ such that $|a_n| \leq M$ for all $n$. 

By the Nested Interval Property, we can construct a nested sequence of closed intervals $I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq \cdots$ where each $I_k$ has length $M/2^{k-1}$ and contains infinitely many terms of $(a_n)$.

By repeatedly selecting terms from these intervals, we obtain a [subsequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/subsequence/) $(a_{n_k})$ that is Cauchy, and hence convergent by the [Cauchy_Criterion](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/cauchy_criterion/).
