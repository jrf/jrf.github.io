## Definition

If $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is [continuous](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/continuity/), and if $L$ is a real number satisfying $f(a) < L < f(b)$ or $f(b) < L < f(a)$, then there exists a point $c \in (a,b)$ where $f(c) = L$.

In other words, a [continuous](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/continuity/) [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) on a closed interval attains every value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.

## Proof

Without loss of generality, assume $f(a) < L < f(b)$. Define the set



$$
K = \{x \in [a,b] : f(x) < L\}
$$



Since $a \in K$, the set is nonempty. Since $K \subseteq [a,b]$, it is bounded above. Let $c = \sup K$.

By [continuity](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/continuity/), if $f(c) < L$, we could find a neighborhood where $f(x) < L$, contradicting that $c$ is the [supremum](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/supremum/). Similarly, if $f(c) > L$, we could find a neighborhood where $f(x) > L$, contradicting that $c$ is an [upper_bound](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/upper_bound/) for $K$.

Therefore $f(c) = L$.
