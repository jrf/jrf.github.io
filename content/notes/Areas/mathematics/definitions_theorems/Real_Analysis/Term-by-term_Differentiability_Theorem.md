## Definition

Let $(f_n)$ be a [sequence](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/sequence/) of [differentiable](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/differentiable/) functions on the interval $[a,b]$, and assume $(f_n')$ converges [uniformly](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/uniform_convergence/) on $[a,b]$. If there exists a point $x_0 \in [a,b]$ for which $(f_n(x_0))$ converges, then:

1. $(f_n)$ converges [uniformly](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/uniform_convergence/) on $[a,b]$
2. The limit function $f = \lim f_n$ is [differentiable](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/differentiable/)
3. $f' = \lim f_n'$ on $[a,b]$

## Proof Sketch

The key is to use the [Mean_Value_Theorem](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/mean_value_theorem/) to show that uniform convergence of derivatives, combined with pointwise convergence at one point, implies uniform convergence of the functions.

For any $x, y \in [a,b]$:


$$
|f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \leq |f_n(x) - f_n(x_0)| + |f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0)| + |f_m(x_0) - f_m(x)|
$$



Apply MVT to bound the first and third terms using the uniform convergence of $(f_n')$.
