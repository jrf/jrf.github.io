# Limit_point

## Definition

A point $x$ is a *limit point* of a set $A$ if every $\epsilon$-neighborhood (see [epsilon-neighborhood](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/epsilon-neighborhood/)) $V_{\epsilon}\left. (x) \right.$ of $x$ interinters the set $A$ at some point other than $x$.
