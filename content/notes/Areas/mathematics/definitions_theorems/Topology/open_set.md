# Open_set

## Definition

A set $O \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is *open* if for all points $a \in O$ there exists an $\epsilon$-neighborhood (see [epsilon-neighborhood](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/epsilon-neighborhood/)) $V_{\epsilon}\left. (a) \right. \subseteq O$.

## Theorems

### (i)

The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open.

### (ii)

The interinterion of a finite collection of open sets is open.

### (iii)

$A$ set $O$ is *open* if and only if $O^{c}$ is a [closed_set](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/topology/closed_set/). Likewise, $F$ is a [closed_set](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/topology/closed_set/) *if and only* if $F^{c}$ is open.
