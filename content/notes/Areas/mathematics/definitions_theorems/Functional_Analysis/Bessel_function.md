**Bessel functions** are canonical solutions $y(x)$ to Bessel's differential equation:



$$
x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \frac{dy}{dx} + (x^2 - \alpha^2) y = 0
$$



where $\alpha$ is a constant (the order of the Bessel function).

## Bessel Functions of the First Kind

The **Bessel function of the first kind** of order $n$, denoted $J_n(x)$, is defined by the series:



$$
J_n(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \, \Gamma(m + n + 1)} \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^{2m + n}
$$



For integer order $n$, this simplifies to:



$$
J_n(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \, (m + n)!} \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^{2m + n}
$$



## Integral Representation

The zeroth-order Bessel function has the integral representation:



$$
J_0(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \cos(x \sin \theta) \, d\theta
$$



## Applications in Fourier Optics

In the context of circularly symmetric functions, the two-dimensional [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/functional_analysis/fourier_transform/) reduces to a **Hankel transform** (or Fourier-Bessel transform):



$$
G(\rho) = 2\pi \int_0^\infty g(r) J_0(2\pi \rho r) \, r \, dr
$$



where $J_0$ is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind.
