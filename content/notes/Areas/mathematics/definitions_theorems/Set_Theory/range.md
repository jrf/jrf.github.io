# Range

## Definition

The range of a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) may refer to either of two closely related concepts:

- The [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/codomain/) of the [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/)

- The [image](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/image/) of the [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/)

The above graphic shows a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $f$ from $X$ to $Y$. The blue oval $Y$ is the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/codomain/) of $f$. The red oval $X$ is the [domain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/domain/) of $f$. The blue oval $Y$ is the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/codomain/) of $f$. The yellow oval inside $Y$ is the [image](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/image/) of $f$.
