# Surjection

## Definition

A [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is *surjective* (also referred to as *onto*) if, given any $x \in X$, it is possible to find an element $y \in Y$ for which $f\left. (x) \right. = y$.

In other words, the property of being *surjective* ensures that every element of $Y$ corresponds to something in $X$.
