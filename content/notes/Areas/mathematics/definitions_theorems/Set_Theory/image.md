# Image

## Definition

The image of a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) is the set of all output values it may produce.

More generally, evaluating a given [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $f$ at each element of a given subset $A$ of its [domain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/domain/) produces a set, called the "image of $A$ under (or through) $f$". Similarly, the inverse [image](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/image/) (or [preimage](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/preimage/)) of a given subset $B$ of the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/codomain/) of $f$, is the set of all elements of the [domain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/domain/) that map to the members of $B$.

The above graphic shows a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $f$ from $X$ to $Y$. The blue oval $Y$ is the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/codomain/) of $f$. The red oval $X$ is the [domain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/domain/) of $f$. The blue oval $Y$ is the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/codomain/) of $f$. The yellow oval inside $Y$ is the [image](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/image/) of $f$.
