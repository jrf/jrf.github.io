# Codomain

## Definition

The *codomain* of a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) is the set into which all of the output of the [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) is constrained to fall. It is the set $Y$ in the notation $f:X \rightarrow Y$. The term [range](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/range/) is sometimes ambiguously used to refer to either the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/codomain/) or [image](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/image/) of a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/).

The above graphic shows a [function](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/function/) $f$ from $X$ to $Y$. The blue oval $Y$ is the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/codomain/) of $f$. The red oval $X$ is the [domain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/domain/) of $f$. The blue oval $Y$ is the [codomain](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/codomain/) of $f$. The yellow oval inside $Y$ is the [image](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/set_theory/image/) of $f$.
