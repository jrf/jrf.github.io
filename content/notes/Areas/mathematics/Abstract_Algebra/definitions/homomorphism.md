## Definition

A **homomorphism** is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type.

For a map $\phi: A \to B$ to be a homomorphism, it must preserve the relevant operations.

## In Different Contexts

| Structure | Homomorphism condition |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Groups** | $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$ |
| **Rings** | $\phi(a + b) = \phi(a) + \phi(b)$ and $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$ |
| **Vector spaces** | $\phi(ax + by) = a\phi(x) + b\phi(y)$ (linear map) |
| **Modules** | Preserves addition and scalar multiplication |

## Key Properties

If $\phi: A \to B$ is a homomorphism:

- $\phi(e_A) = e_B$ (identity maps to identity)
- $\phi(a^{-1}) = \phi(a)^{-1}$ (inverses map to inverses)
- The image $\phi(A)$ is a substructure of $B$
- The kernel $\ker(\phi) = \{a : \phi(a) = e_B\}$ is a substructure of $A$

## Special Cases

| Name | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Monomorphism** | Injective homomorphism |
| **Epimorphism** | Surjective homomorphism |
| **[isomorphism](/notes/areas/mathematics/abstract_algebra/definitions/isomorphism/)** | Bijective homomorphism |
| **Endomorphism** | Homomorphism from a structure to itself |
| **[automorphism](/notes/areas/mathematics/abstract_algebra/definitions/automorphism/)** | Bijective endomorphism |

## Intuition

A homomorphism "respects" the structure. It may lose information (not injective) or miss parts of the target (not surjective), but it never breaks the algebraic relationships.

## Examples

- $\phi: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_n$ given by $\phi(k) = k \mod n$ (group homomorphism)
- $\det: GL_n(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}^*$ (the determinant is a group homomorphism)
- Any [linear transformation](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/linear_transformation/) is a [vector space](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/vector_space/) homomorphism
