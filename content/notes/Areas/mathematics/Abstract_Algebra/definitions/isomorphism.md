## Definition

An **isomorphism** is a [bijection](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/bijection/) between two mathematical structures that preserves the structure's operations.

Two structures are **isomorphic** if an isomorphism exists between them — they are "the same" up to relabeling.

## In Different Contexts

| Context | Isomorphism preserves |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Sets** | Just a bijection (no extra structure) |
| **Groups** | $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$ |
| **Rings** | Addition and multiplication |
| **Vector spaces** | Linear combinations |
| **Topological spaces** | Open sets (homeomorphism) |
| **Metric spaces** | Distances (isometry) |
| **Inner product spaces** | Inner products (unitary isomorphism) |

## Key Idea

If $\phi: A \to B$ is an isomorphism, then:

1. **Bijection**: $\phi$ is one-to-one and onto
2. **Structure-preserving**: Operations in $A$ correspond to operations in $B$
3. **Invertible**: $\phi^{-1}: B \to A$ is also an isomorphism

## Examples

- $(\mathbb{R}, +) \cong (\mathbb{R}^+, \times)$ via $\phi(x) = e^x$
- The [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) is a unitary isomorphism $L^2(\mathbb{R}) \to L^2(\mathbb{R})$
- Any two finite-dimensional vector spaces of the same dimension are isomorphic

## Intuition

Isomorphic structures are "mathematically identical" — they have the same abstract properties. The specific elements don't matter; only their relationships do.

## Related Concepts

- [Bijection](/notes/areas/mathematics/set_theory/definitions/bijection/) — an isomorphism is a structure-preserving bijection
- [homomorphism](/notes/areas/mathematics/abstract_algebra/definitions/homomorphism/) — structure-preserving map (not necessarily bijective)
- [automorphism](/notes/areas/mathematics/abstract_algebra/definitions/automorphism/) — isomorphism from a structure to itself
