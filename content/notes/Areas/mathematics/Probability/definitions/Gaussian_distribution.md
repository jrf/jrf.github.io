The **Gaussian distribution** (also called the **normal distribution**) is the most important probability distribution in statistics and physics.

## Probability Density Function



$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$



where:
- $\mu$ = mean (center of the distribution)
- $\sigma$ = standard deviation (spread)
- $\sigma^2$ = variance

The standard normal distribution has $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$.

## Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Mean | $\mu$ |
| Variance | $\sigma^2$ |
| Skewness | 0 |
| Kurtosis | 3 |

**68-95-99.7 Rule**: Approximately 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of values lie within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean.

## Why It's Everywhere

### Central Limit Theorem

The sum of many independent random variables tends toward a Gaussian distribution, regardless of the original distributions. This explains why Gaussian distributions appear in:
- Measurement errors
- Thermal noise
- Brownian motion

### Maximum Entropy

Among all distributions with a given mean and variance, the Gaussian has maximum entropy — it assumes the least additional structure.

## Fourier Transform

The Gaussian is an [eigenfunction](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/eigenfunction/) of the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/):



$$
\mathcal{F}\{e^{-\pi x^2}\} = e^{-\pi f^2}
$$



A Gaussian transforms into another Gaussian.

## Multidimensional Gaussian

In $n$ dimensions with mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$:



$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}|\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|^{1/2}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} (\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})\right)
$$



## Applications

- Statistics and hypothesis testing
- Machine learning (Gaussian processes, GMMs)
- Physics (thermal distributions, quantum mechanics)
- Signal processing (noise models)
- Finance (Black-Scholes model)
