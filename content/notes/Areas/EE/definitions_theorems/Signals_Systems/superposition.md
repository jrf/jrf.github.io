## Definition

The *superposition principle* states that for a linear system, the response to a sum of inputs equals the sum of the responses to each individual input.

If $\mathcal{L}$ is a linear operator, then:



$$
\mathcal{L}\{a_1 f_1(x) + a_2 f_2(x)\} = a_1 \mathcal{L}\{f_1(x)\} + a_2 \mathcal{L}\{f_2(x)\}
$$



for all scalars $a_1, a_2$ and all inputs $f_1, f_2$ in the domain of $\mathcal{L}$.

## Remarks

- Superposition is the defining property of **linearity** in systems theory.
- It allows complex inputs to be decomposed into simpler components, each analyzed separately, then recombined.
- In optics and signal processing, this principle enables techniques like [Fourier analysis](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/functional_analysis/fourier_transform/), where inputs are expressed as sums of eigenfunctions (complex exponentials).

## Superposition Integral

For a linear system with impulse response $h(x; x_0)$, the output is given by the superposition integral:



$$
g(x) = \int f(x_0) \, h(x; x_0) \, dx_0
$$



This represents the response as a weighted sum (integral) of impulse responses.
