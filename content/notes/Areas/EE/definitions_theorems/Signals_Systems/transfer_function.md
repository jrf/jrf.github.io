The **transfer function** of a linear, shift-invariant system characterizes the system's response in the frequency domain.

## Definition

For a system with [impulse response](/notes/areas/ee/definitions_theorems/signals_systems/impulse_response/) $h(x, y)$, the transfer function $H(f_x, f_y)$ is the Fourier transform of the impulse response:



$$
H(f_x, f_y) = \iint_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(x, y) \, e^{-j2\pi(f_x x + f_y y)} \, dx \, dy
$$



## Input-Output Relationship

For an input $g_1(x, y)$ with Fourier transform $G_1(f_x, f_y)$, the output $g_2(x, y)$ has Fourier transform:



$$
G_2(f_x, f_y) = H(f_x, f_y) \cdot G_1(f_x, f_y)
$$



This follows from the convolution theorem: multiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to [convolution](/notes/areas/mathematics/definitions_theorems/real_analysis/convolution/) in the spatial domain.

## Properties

- **Magnitude** $|H(f_x, f_y)|$: describes amplitude scaling at each frequency
- **Phase** $\arg H(f_x, f_y)$: describes phase shift at each frequency
- A system is **stable** if the transfer function is bounded

## Optical Transfer Function (OTF)

In optics, the transfer function of an imaging system is called the **Optical Transfer Function**. Its magnitude is the **Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)**, and its phase is the **Phase Transfer Function (PTF)**.
