**Fraunhofer diffraction** (also called **far-field diffraction**) is the diffraction pattern observed when both the light source and observation screen are effectively at infinite distance from the diffracting aperture.

## Fraunhofer Condition

The Fraunhofer approximation is valid when:



$$
z \gg \frac{a^2}{\lambda}
$$



where $z$ is the propagation distance, $a$ is the aperture size, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

## Key Properties

- The diffraction pattern is the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) of the aperture function
- Pattern shape is independent of distance (only scales)
- Intensity distribution: $I(f_x, f_y) \propto |T(f_x, f_y)|^2$ where $T$ is the aperture transmittance

## Examples

- Circular aperture → [Airy disk](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/airy_disk/)
- Rectangular aperture → sinc$^2$ pattern
- Diffraction grating → discrete diffraction orders
