**Computed tomography** (CT), also called **computerized axial tomography** (CAT), is a medical imaging technique that reconstructs cross-sectional images from X-ray projections taken at multiple angles.

## Physical Principle

1. An X-ray source rotates around the patient
2. X-rays are attenuated according to the [Beer-Lambert law](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/beer_lambert_law/) as they pass through tissue
3. Detectors [measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/measure/) the transmitted intensity
4. Each measurement represents a line integral of the attenuation coefficient (a [Radon transform](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/radon_transform/))

## Mathematical Foundation

The reconstruction relies on the [projection-slice theorem](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/projection_slice_theorem/):

- Each projection at angle $\theta$ gives one radial slice of the 2D [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/)
- Collecting projections at many angles fills the Fourier plane
- Inverse [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) recovers the image

## Reconstruction Algorithms

### Filtered Back-Projection

The standard clinical algorithm:

1. Apply a **ramp filter** $|\nu|$ to each projection (compensates for non-uniform radial [sampling](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/sampling/))
2. "Smear" each filtered projection back across the image at its original angle
3. Sum contributions from all angles

### Iterative Methods

Modern approaches that can handle:
- Sparse data (fewer projections)
- Noise reduction
- Prior knowledge constraints

## Hounsfield Units

CT images are displayed in **Hounsfield units** (HU):



$$
HU = 1000 \times \frac{\mu - \mu_{water}}{\mu_{water} - \mu_{air}}
$$



| Material | HU |
|----------|-----|
| Air | -1000 |
| Water | 0 |
| Soft tissue | +40 to +80 |
| Bone | +400 to +1000 |

## Applications

- Diagnostic imaging (trauma, cancer, cardiovascular)
- Radiation therapy planning
- Industrial inspection (non-destructive testing)
