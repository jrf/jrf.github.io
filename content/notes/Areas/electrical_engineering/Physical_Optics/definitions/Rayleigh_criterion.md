The **Rayleigh criterion** is a widely used standard for determining when two point sources can be distinguished (resolved) by an optical system.

## Statement

Two point sources are considered **just resolved** when the central maximum of one source's [Airy pattern](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/airy_disk/) falls on the first minimum (first dark ring) of the other's.

For a circular aperture of diameter $D$:



$$
\theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
$$



where:
- $\theta_{\text{min}}$ = minimum resolvable angular separation (radians)
- $\lambda$ = wavelength of light
- $D$ = aperture diameter

## Derivation

The [angular spectrum](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/angular_spectrum/) of a circular aperture gives the [Airy pattern](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/airy_disk/):



$$
I(\theta) \propto \left[\frac{2J_1(\pi D \sin\theta / \lambda)}{\pi D \sin\theta / \lambda}\right]^2
$$



The first zero of $J_1(x)$ occurs at $x \approx 3.83$, giving:



$$
\sin\theta_{\text{first zero}} = \frac{3.83 \lambda}{\pi D} \approx 1.22\frac{\lambda}{D}
$$



For small angles, $\sin\theta \approx \theta$.

## Visual Interpretation

| Separation | Appearance |
|------------|------------|
| $\theta > 1.22\lambda/D$ | Clearly resolved (distinct peaks) |
| $\theta = 1.22\lambda/D$ | Just resolved (central dip visible) |
| $\theta < 1.22\lambda/D$ | Unresolved (single merged peak) |

At the Rayleigh limit, the combined intensity shows a dip of about 26% between the two peaks.

## Applications

### Telescopes



$$
\theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
$$



Larger aperture → better angular resolution. This drives the desire for large telescope mirrors.

| Telescope | Diameter | Resolution at 550 nm |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| Human eye | 7 mm | 1 arcminute |
| Hubble | 2.4 m | 0.05 arcsec |
| James Webb | 6.5 m | 0.07 arcsec (at 2 μm) |

### Microscopes

For a microscope with numerical aperture NA:



$$
d_{\text{min}} = 0.61 \frac{\lambda}{\text{NA}}
$$



This is the minimum resolvable distance between two points.

### Photography

The **f-number** relates to resolution. Higher f-numbers (smaller apertures) reduce resolution due to [diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/diffraction/):



$$
\theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22 \lambda \cdot (f/\#) / f
$$



## Limitations

The Rayleigh criterion is somewhat arbitrary:
- Other criteria exist (Sparrow, Houston)
- Signal processing can improve resolution beyond this limit (super-resolution)
- It assumes incoherent illumination and no noise

However, it remains the standard benchmark for optical system resolution.
