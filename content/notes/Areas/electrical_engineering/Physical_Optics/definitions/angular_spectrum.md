The **angular spectrum** is a method for representing optical fields as a superposition of plane waves traveling in different directions. It provides an exact solution to the wave equation and is particularly useful for analyzing [diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/diffraction/) and propagation.

## Definition

For a monochromatic field $U(x, y, z)$ at a plane $z = 0$, the angular spectrum is defined as the 2D [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/):



$$
A(f_x, f_y; 0) = \mathcal{F}\{U(x, y, 0)\} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} U(x, y, 0) \, e^{-j2\pi(f_x x + f_y y)} \, dx \, dy
$$



where $f_x$ and $f_y$ are spatial frequencies (cycles per unit length).

## Physical Interpretation

Each point $(f_x, f_y)$ in the angular spectrum represents a **plane wave** traveling in a specific direction. The spatial frequencies relate to propagation angles by:



$$
\sin\theta_x = \lambda f_x, \quad \sin\theta_y = \lambda f_y
$$



where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $\theta_x$, $\theta_y$ are the angles from the optical axis.

| Spatial Frequency | Physical Meaning |
|-------------------|------------------|
| $(0, 0)$ | On-axis plane wave (straight through) |
| Large $f_x$ or $f_y$ | Steeply angled plane waves |
| $\sqrt{f_x^2 + f_y^2} > 1/\lambda$ | Evanescent waves (don't propagate) |

## Propagation

The angular spectrum at a distance $z$ is:



$$
A(f_x, f_y; z) = A(f_x, f_y; 0) \cdot e^{j k_z z}
$$



where the $z$-component of the wave vector is:



$$
k_z = \begin{cases}
2\pi\sqrt{\frac{1}{\lambda^2} - f_x^2 - f_y^2} & \text{if } f_x^2 + f_y^2 < \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \text{ (propagating)} \\
j2\pi\sqrt{f_x^2 + f_y^2 - \frac{1}{\lambda^2}} & \text{if } f_x^2 + f_y^2 > \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \text{ (evanescent)}
\end{cases}
$$



The field at any plane $z$ is obtained by inverse Fourier transform:



$$
U(x, y, z) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{A(f_x, f_y; z)\}
$$



## Advantages

- **Exact**: No paraxial or Fresnel approximations required
- **Intuitive**: Decomposes fields into plane wave components
- **Computational**: Efficiently implemented via FFT algorithms
- **Unified**: Handles both [Fresnel](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/fresnel_diffraction/) and [Fraunhofer](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/fraunhofer_diffraction/) regimes

## Connection to Diffraction

For an aperture with transmission function $t(x, y)$ illuminated by a unit-amplitude plane wave:



$$
A(f_x, f_y) = \mathcal{F}\{t(x, y)\}
$$



This directly gives the diffracted field's angular distribution.
