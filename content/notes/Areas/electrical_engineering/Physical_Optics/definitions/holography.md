**Holography** is a technique for recording and reconstructing the complete wavefront of light, including both amplitude and phase information.

## Principle

Unlike photography which records only intensity, holography records the interference pattern between:
- **Object wave**: light scattered from the object
- **Reference wave**: a coherent reference beam

## Recording

The hologram transmittance encodes the interference pattern:



$$
t(x,y) \propto |U_{\text{obj}} + U_{\text{ref}}|^2
$$



This contains terms proportional to:
- $|U_{\text{ref}}|^2$ (DC term)
- $|U_{\text{obj}}|^2$ (halo)
- $U_{\text{obj}} U_{\text{ref}}^*$ (virtual image)
- $U_{\text{obj}}^* U_{\text{ref}}$ (real image)

## Reconstruction

Illuminating the hologram with the reference wave reconstructs the original object wave, creating a 3D image.

## Types

- **On-axis (Gabor) hologram**: Reference and object beams colinear
- **Off-axis hologram**: Angled reference beam separates image terms
- **Reflection hologram**: Viewable in white light

## Requirements

- [Coherence](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/coherence/): Source must have sufficient temporal and spatial coherence
- Stability: Sub-wavelength stability during recording
