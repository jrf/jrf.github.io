**Babinet's principle** states that the [diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/diffraction/) patterns from complementary screens are identical except for the directly transmitted light.

## Statement

Two screens are **complementary** if their transmission functions sum to unity:



$$
t_1(x, y) + t_2(x, y) = 1
$$



For example:
- A circular aperture and a circular opaque disk of the same size
- A single slit and a thin wire of the same width
- Any aperture and its photographic negative

Babinet's principle states:



$$
U_1(x, y) + U_2(x, y) = U_0(x, y)
$$



where:
- $U_1$ = diffracted field from screen 1
- $U_2$ = diffracted field from screen 2
- $U_0$ = unobstructed field (no screen present)

## In the Angular Spectrum

For the [angular spectrum](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/angular_spectrum/):



$$
A_1(f_x, f_y) + A_2(f_x, f_y) = \delta(f_x, f_y)
$$



The delta function represents the unobstructed [plane wave](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/plane_wave/). Therefore:



$$
A_2(f_x, f_y) = \delta(f_x, f_y) - A_1(f_x, f_y)
$$



## Consequences

### Intensity Away from the Axis

For points away from the optical axis (where the delta function doesn't contribute):



$$
|A_2|^2 = |A_1|^2
$$



The [diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/diffraction/) patterns have **identical intensity** except at the center.

### On-Axis Difference

At the center ($f_x = f_y = 0$):
- The aperture transmits the direct beam
- The opaque obstacle blocks it

This is the only difference between the patterns.

## Famous Example: Poisson's Spot

When Fresnel proposed his wave theory of light, Poisson (a skeptic) pointed out it predicted a bright spot at the center of a circular disk's shadow — seemingly absurd. Arago then demonstrated this spot experimentally, confirming the wave theory.

The spot occurs because diffracted waves from the disk's edge constructively interfere at the center. Babinet's principle explains why: the disk's [diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/diffraction/) pattern matches the aperture's, which has a central maximum.

## Applications

| Application | How Babinet's Principle Helps |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Calculating wire [diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/diffraction/) | Use easier slit calculation, add DC |
| Particle sizing | [Measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/measure/) [diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/diffraction/) to determine size |
| Optical testing | Complementary masks give identical fringes |
