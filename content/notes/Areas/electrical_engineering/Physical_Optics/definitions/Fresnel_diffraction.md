**Fresnel diffraction** (also called **near-field diffraction**) is the diffraction pattern observed when the source or observation screen is at a finite distance from the diffracting aperture.

## Fresnel Approximation

The Fresnel approximation uses a quadratic phase approximation:



$$
\gamma_z \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2}(\gamma_x^2 + \gamma_y^2)
$$



valid when $\gamma_x \ll 1$ and $\gamma_y \ll 1$ (small angles).

## Fresnel Condition

The Fresnel approximation is valid when:



$$
z \ll \frac{a^4}{\lambda^3}
$$



where $z$ is the propagation distance, $a$ is the aperture size, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

## Key Properties

- Pattern changes shape with propagation distance
- More complex than [Fraunhofer diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/fraunhofer_diffraction/)
- Involves Fresnel integrals or quadratic phase factors
