The **Nyquist criterion** (also called **Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem**) states the minimum sampling rate required to perfectly reconstruct a band-limited signal.

## Statement

If a signal is **band-limited** with maximum frequency $B$, it must be sampled at a rate:



$$
f_s \geq 2B
$$



or equivalently, the sample spacing must satisfy:



$$
a \leq \frac{1}{2B}
$$



## Key Concepts

- **Nyquist frequency**: The sampling rate $f_s = 1/a$
- **Folding frequency**: The bandwidth limit $B$ where aliasing begins
- **Aliasing**: Spectral overlap that occurs when the Nyquist criterion is violated

## In Two Dimensions

For 2D signals with bandlimits $B_x$ and $B_y$:



$$
\frac{1}{a} \geq 2B_x, \quad \frac{1}{b} \geq 2B_y
$$



## Recovery

If the Nyquist criterion is satisfied, the original signal can be recovered by low-pass filtering:



$$
g(x,y) = g_s(x,y) \ast [4B_x B_y \, \text{sinc}(2B_x x) \, \text{sinc}(2B_y y)]
$$
