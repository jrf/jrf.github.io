A **Gaussian beam** is a beam of electromagnetic radiation whose transverse electric field and intensity profiles are described by Gaussian functions. Laser beams are well-approximated as Gaussian beams.

## Transverse Profile

The electric field amplitude varies as:



$$
E(r) = E_0 \exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{w^2}\right)
$$



where $w$ is the **beam radius** (where intensity falls to $1/e^2$ of the peak).

The intensity profile is:



$$
I(r) = I_0 \exp\left(-\frac{2r^2}{w^2}\right)
$$



## Propagation

As a Gaussian beam propagates along $z$, the beam radius evolves as:



$$
w(z) = w_0 \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{z}{z_R}\right)^2}
$$



where:
- $w_0$ = beam waist (minimum radius)
- $z_R = \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda}$ = **Rayleigh range**

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Beam waist $w_0$ | Minimum beam radius |
| Rayleigh range $z_R$ | Distance where $w = \sqrt{2} w_0$ |
| Divergence angle $\theta$ | $\theta = \lambda / (\pi w_0)$ |
| Confocal parameter $b$ | $b = 2 z_R$ |

## Self-Fourier Property

The Gaussian function is an eigenfunction of the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/):



$$
\mathcal{F}\{e^{-\pi x^2}\} = e^{-\pi f^2}
$$



This explains why Gaussian beams maintain their Gaussian profile as they propagate and diffract — a unique property among beam shapes.

## Beam Quality Factor (M²)

Real laser beams deviate from ideal Gaussian behavior. The **M² factor** quantifies this:



$$
M^2 = \frac{\pi w_0 \theta}{\lambda}
$$



For an ideal Gaussian beam, $M^2 = 1$.
