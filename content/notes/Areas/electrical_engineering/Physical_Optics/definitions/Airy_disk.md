The **Airy disk** is the diffraction pattern formed when light passes through a circular aperture. It consists of a bright central spot surrounded by concentric rings of decreasing intensity.

## Mathematical Description

The intensity pattern is given by:



$$
I(\rho) \propto \left[\frac{J_1(2\pi\rho)}{\rho}\right]^2
$$



where $J_1$ is the first-order [Bessel function](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/bessel_function/) and $\rho$ is the radial coordinate in the Fourier plane.

## Physical Significance

- Describes the [Fraunhofer diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/fraunhofer_diffraction/) pattern of a circular aperture
- Represents the [point spread function](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/point_spread_function/) of a circular lens
- Sets the fundamental limit of optical resolution

## Related Terms

- Also called: **Airy pattern**, **jinc function**, **sombrero function**
- The central maximum contains approximately 84% of the total light energy
