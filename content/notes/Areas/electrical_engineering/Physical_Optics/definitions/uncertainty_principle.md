The **uncertainty principle** expresses a fundamental limit on the precision with which certain pairs of physical quantities can be simultaneously known. It arises from the wave nature of matter and the properties of the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/).

## Fourier Uncertainty Principle

For any function $f(x)$ and its Fourier transform $F(\nu)$:



$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta \nu \geq \frac{1}{4\pi}
$$



where $\Delta x$ and $\Delta \nu$ are the root-mean-square widths (standard deviations) in position and frequency.

**Interpretation**: A signal cannot be simultaneously localized in both time/space and frequency. Narrow in one domain means wide in the other.

## Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

In quantum mechanics, for position $x$ and momentum $p$:



$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$



where $\hbar = h/(2\pi)$ is the reduced Planck constant.

This is a direct consequence of the Fourier relationship between position and momentum wavefunctions:


$$
\psi(x) \xleftrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} \phi(p)
$$



## Minimum Uncertainty States

The Gaussian function achieves the minimum uncertainty product:



$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta \nu = \frac{1}{4\pi}
$$



This is why [Gaussian beams](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/gaussian_beam/) and Gaussian wave packets are special — they are as localized as possible in both domains simultaneously.

## Time-Frequency Uncertainty

For time $t$ and frequency $f$:



$$
\Delta t \cdot \Delta f \geq \frac{1}{4\pi}
$$



**Applications**:
- Short pulses have broad spectra
- Narrow spectral lines require long coherence times
- Radar resolution limits
- Musical notes: short notes have less definite pitch

## Time-Bandwidth Product

The **time-bandwidth product** $\Delta t \cdot \Delta f$ characterizes signals:
- Gaussian pulse: $\Delta t \cdot \Delta f = 0.44$
- Rectangular pulse: $\Delta t \cdot \Delta f = 0.89$
- Transform-limited pulses have the minimum product for their shape

## In Optics

The uncertainty principle manifests as:
- [Diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/diffraction/) limits (small apertures → wide angular spread)
- Coherence length and bandwidth relationship
- Pulse broadening in dispersive media
