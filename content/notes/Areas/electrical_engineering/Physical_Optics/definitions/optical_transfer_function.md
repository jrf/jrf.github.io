The **Optical Transfer Function (OTF)** describes how an optical system transmits spatial frequencies from object to image. It is the Fourier transform of the [point spread function](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/point_spread_function/):



$$
\text{OTF}(f_x, f_y) = \mathcal{F}\{\text{PSF}(x, y)\}
$$



## Definition

For a [linear shift-invariant](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/linear_shift-invariant_system/) imaging system:



$$
\tilde{G}_{\text{image}}(f_x, f_y) = \text{OTF}(f_x, f_y) \cdot \tilde{G}_{\text{object}}(f_x, f_y)
$$



The OTF is the [transfer function](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/transfer_function/) of the imaging system in the spatial frequency domain.

## Components

The OTF is generally complex-valued and can be decomposed into:



$$
\text{OTF}(f_x, f_y) = \text{MTF}(f_x, f_y) \cdot e^{j \, \text{PTF}(f_x, f_y)}
$$



- **MTF (Modulation Transfer Function):** The magnitude $|\text{OTF}|$. Describes contrast reduction at each spatial frequency.
- **PTF (Phase Transfer Function):** The phase $\arg(\text{OTF})$. Describes spatial phase shifts (lateral displacement of features).

## Relationship to Pupil Function

For a diffraction-limited system with pupil function $P(x, y)$, the OTF is the **autocorrelation** of the pupil:



$$
\text{OTF}(f_x, f_y) = \frac{\iint P(\xi, \eta) \, P^*(\xi - \lambda z_i f_x, \eta - \lambda z_i f_y) \, d\xi \, d\eta}{\iint |P(\xi, \eta)|^2 \, d\xi \, d\eta}
$$



This is normalized so that $\text{OTF}(0, 0) = 1$.

## Cutoff Frequency

For a circular aperture of diameter $D$ at f-number $F = z_i / D$:



$$
f_{\text{cutoff}} = \frac{1}{\lambda F} = \frac{D}{\lambda z_i}
$$



The OTF is zero for all frequencies above this cutoff — the optical system acts as a **low-pass filter**.

## Key Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| $\text{OTF}(0,0) = 1$ | Normalized to unity at zero frequency |
| $\text{OTF}(f) = \text{OTF}^*(-f)$ | Hermitian symmetry (for real PSF) |
| $\|\text{OTF}\| \leq 1$ | Contrast can only decrease, never increase |
| Cutoff at $1/\lambda F$ | No transmission above diffraction limit |

## Physical Interpretation

- **Low frequencies** (large features): Transmitted with high contrast
- **High frequencies** (fine details): Attenuated, with cutoff at diffraction limit
- **Aberrations** reduce MTF below the diffraction-limited ideal
- **Defocus** causes the MTF to oscillate and can produce contrast reversal
