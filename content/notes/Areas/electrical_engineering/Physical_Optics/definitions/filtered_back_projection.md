**Filtered back-projection** (FBP) is the standard algorithm for reconstructing images in [computed tomography](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/computed_tomography/) (CT). It implements the inverse [Radon transform](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/radon_transform/).

## The Problem with Simple Back-Projection

Naive back-projection (smearing each projection back across the image) produces a blurred result. This blur has a $1/r$ characteristic — the point spread function of unfiltered back-projection.

## The Ramp Filter

The solution is to filter each projection before back-projecting. The required filter has frequency response:



$$
H(\nu) = |\nu|
$$



This is called the **ramp filter** because its magnitude increases linearly with frequency.

### Why a Ramp?

The [projection-slice theorem](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/projection_slice_theorem/) fills Fourier space along radial lines. Near the origin, samples are densely packed; far from the origin, they're sparse. The ramp filter compensates for this non-uniform sampling density.

## Algorithm

1. **Acquire** projections $p_\theta(s)$ at angles $\theta \in [0, \pi)$
2. **Filter** each projection:
   

$$
q_\theta(s) = p_\theta(s) * h(s)
$$


   where $h(s) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{|\nu|\}$
3. **Back-project** the filtered projections:
   

$$
f(x,y) = \int_0^\pi q_\theta(x\cos\theta + y\sin\theta) \, d\theta
$$



## Practical Considerations

### Windowing

The pure ramp filter amplifies high-frequency noise. Practical implementations multiply by a window function:

- **Ram-Lak**: $|\nu|$ (no windowing)
- **Shepp-Logan**: $|\nu| \cdot \text{sinc}(\nu/2\nu_{max})$
- **Hamming**: $|\nu| \cdot (0.54 + 0.46\cos(\pi\nu/\nu_{max}))$

### Discrete Implementation

In practice:
- Projections are sampled discretely
- FFT is used for filtering
- Back-projection uses interpolation
