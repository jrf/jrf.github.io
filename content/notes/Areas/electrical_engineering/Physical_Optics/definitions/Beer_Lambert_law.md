The **Beer-Lambert law** (also called **Beer's law**) describes the attenuation of light or radiation as it passes through a material.

## Statement

For monochromatic radiation passing through a homogeneous medium:



$$
I = I_0 e^{-\mu x}
$$



where:
- $I_0$ = incident intensity
- $I$ = transmitted intensity
- $\mu$ = attenuation coefficient (units: 1/length)
- $x$ = path length through the material

## Differential Form

The intensity decreases proportionally to the current intensity:



$$
\frac{dI}{dx} = -\mu I
$$



This is why attenuation is multiplicative (exponential) rather than additive.

## For Inhomogeneous Media

When the attenuation coefficient varies with position:



$$
I = I_0 \exp\left(-\int_0^L \mu(x) \, dx\right)
$$



Taking the logarithm:



$$
\ln\left(\frac{I_0}{I}\right) = \int_0^L \mu(x) \, dx
$$



This line integral is exactly what [CT scanners](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/computed_tomography/) measure — the [Radon transform](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/radon_transform/) of the attenuation coefficient.

## Absorbance

In spectroscopy, the **absorbance** $A$ is defined as:



$$
A = \log_{10}\left(\frac{I_0}{I}\right) = \varepsilon c \ell
$$



where:
- $\varepsilon$ = molar absorptivity
- $c$ = concentration
- $\ell$ = path length

## Applications

- **Spectrophotometry**: Measuring concentrations
- **Medical imaging**: X-ray and CT attenuation
- **Atmospheric science**: Light propagation through atmosphere
- **Optical fibers**: Signal attenuation in telecommunications

## Limitations

The law assumes:
- Monochromatic radiation
- No scattering (pure absorption)
- Dilute solutions (for spectroscopy)
- Uniform illumination
