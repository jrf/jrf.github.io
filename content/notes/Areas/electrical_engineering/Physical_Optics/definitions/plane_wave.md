A **plane wave** is a wave whose wavefronts (surfaces of constant phase) are infinite parallel planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

## Mathematical Description

A plane wave solution to the Helmholtz equation:



$$
\hat{u}(\vec{r}) = A e^{j(\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r} + \phi)}
$$



where:
- $A$ is the amplitude
- $\vec{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)$ is the wavevector
- $\phi$ is the phase at the origin

## Direction Cosines

The wavevector can be written as $\vec{k} = k(\gamma_x, \gamma_y, \gamma_z)$ where:
- $\gamma_x, \gamma_y, \gamma_z$ are direction cosines
- $\gamma_x^2 + \gamma_y^2 + \gamma_z^2 = 1$
- $k = 2\pi/\lambda$ is the wavenumber

## Spatial Frequency Relationship

A plane wave tilted at angle $\theta$ from the $z$-axis has spatial frequency:



$$
f_x = \frac{\cos\theta}{\lambda}
$$



This connects the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) to physical wave propagation.

## Propagating vs. Evanescent

- **Propagating**: $\gamma_x^2 + \gamma_y^2 < 1$ → $\gamma_z$ is real
- **Evanescent**: $\gamma_x^2 + \gamma_y^2 > 1$ → $\gamma_z$ is imaginary, field decays exponentially

## Eigenfunctions of Free Space

Plane waves are [eigenfunctions](/notes/areas/mathematics/linear_algebra/definitions/eigenfunction/) of the free-space propagation operator:



$$
e^{jk(\gamma_x x + \gamma_y y)} \xrightarrow{\text{propagate } \Delta z} e^{jk\gamma_z \Delta z} \cdot e^{jk(\gamma_x x + \gamma_y y)}
$$
