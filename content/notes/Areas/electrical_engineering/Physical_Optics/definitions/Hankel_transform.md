The **Hankel transform** (also called **Fourier-Bessel transform**) is the natural transform for circularly symmetric functions in two dimensions.

## Definition

The zero-order Hankel transform of a radially symmetric function $u(r)$ is:



$$
\tilde{U}(\rho) = 2\pi \int_0^{\infty} u(r) J_0(2\pi\rho r) \, r \, dr
$$



where $J_0$ is the zero-order [Bessel function](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/bessel_function/).

## Relationship to 2D Fourier Transform

For a circularly symmetric function $u(r)$ where $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$:
- The 2D [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) is also circularly symmetric
- The Hankel transform gives the radial dependence directly

## Key Transform Pair



$$
\text{circ}(r) \xleftrightarrow{\mathcal{H}} \frac{J_1(2\pi\rho)}{\rho}
$$



This is the [Airy disk](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/airy_disk/) pattern.

## Properties

- Self-inverse (like the Fourier transform for even functions)
- Reduces 2D problems with circular symmetry to 1D
- Used extensively in optics for circular apertures and lenses
