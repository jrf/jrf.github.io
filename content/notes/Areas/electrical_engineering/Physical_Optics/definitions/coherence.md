**Coherence** describes the correlation between the phases of a wave at different points in space or time. It determines the ability of light to produce interference patterns.

## Types of Coherence

### 1. Temporal Coherence (Longitudinal)

Correlation between the field at a single point at different times.

- Related to the spectral bandwidth of the source
- Coherence time: $\tau_c \approx 1/\Delta\nu$
- Coherence length: $L_c = c \cdot \tau_c$

**Examples of high temporal coherence:**
- Laser sources
- Narrowband filtered light

### 2. Spatial Coherence (Transverse)

Correlation between the field at different spatial points at the same time.

- Related to the spatial extent of the source
- Perfect spatial coherence: $|\langle u(x_1) u^*(x_2) \rangle| = 1$

**Examples of high spatial coherence:**
- Stars (point sources at infinity)
- Single-mode laser output

## Van Cittert-Zernike Theorem

The spatial coherence function of light from an incoherent source is the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) of the source intensity distribution.
