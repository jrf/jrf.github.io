The **Radon transform** is an integral transform that computes projections of a function along straight lines. It is the mathematical foundation of [computed tomography](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/computed_tomography/) (CT) imaging.

## Definition

For a 2D function $f(x, y)$, the Radon transform $\mathcal{R}f$ gives the line integral along a line $L$ at angle $\theta$ and distance $s$ from the origin:



$$
\mathcal{R}f(s, \theta) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(s \cos\theta - t \sin\theta, \, s \sin\theta + t \cos\theta) \, dt
$$



For the special case of projection along the $x$-axis (θ = 0):



$$
p(y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x, y) \, dx
$$



## Properties

- **Linearity**: $\mathcal{R}\{af + bg\} = a\mathcal{R}f + b\mathcal{R}g$
- **Shifting**: A shift in $f$ causes a corresponding shift in its projections
- **Rotation**: Rotating $f$ rotates its sinogram (the collection of all projections)

## Connection to Fourier Transform

The [projection-slice theorem](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/projection_slice_theorem/) states that the 1D [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) of a projection equals a slice through the 2D [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) of the original function:



$$
\mathcal{F}_1\{\mathcal{R}f(s, \theta)\} = F(\nu \cos\theta, \nu \sin\theta)
$$



## Applications

- **Medical imaging**: CT scanners [measure](/notes/areas/mathematics/measure_theory/definitions/measure/) Radon transforms (X-ray projections)
- **Electron microscopy**: 3D reconstruction from 2D projections
- **Radio astronomy**: Aperture synthesis imaging
