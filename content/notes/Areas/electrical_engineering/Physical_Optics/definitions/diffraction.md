**Diffraction** is the bending and spreading of waves when they encounter obstacles or pass through apertures. It is a fundamental wave phenomenon that explains why light does not travel in perfectly straight lines.

## Physical Origin

Diffraction arises from the **Huygens-Fresnel principle**: every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary spherical wavelets. The superposition of these wavelets determines the resulting wave pattern.

## Regimes

### Fresnel Diffraction (Near-Field)

When the observation distance is comparable to the aperture size:
- The wavefront curvature matters
- Characterized by **Fresnel number**: $N_F = \frac{a^2}{\lambda z}$
- $N_F \gtrsim 1$ indicates Fresnel regime

See: [Fresnel diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/fresnel_diffraction/)

### Fraunhofer Diffraction (Far-Field)

When the observation distance is much larger than the aperture:
- Wavefronts are approximately planar
- The diffraction pattern is the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) of the aperture function
- $N_F \ll 1$ indicates Fraunhofer regime

See: [Fraunhofer diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/fraunhofer_diffraction/)

## Key Patterns

| Aperture | Diffraction Pattern |
|----------|---------------------|
| Single slit | sinc² intensity distribution |
| Circular aperture | [Airy disk](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/airy_disk/) (Bessel function) |
| Double slit | Interference fringes modulated by sinc |
| Grating | Sharp diffraction orders |

## Resolution Limit

Diffraction fundamentally limits optical resolution. The **Rayleigh criterion** states that two point sources are just resolved when the center of one [Airy disk](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/airy_disk/) falls on the first minimum of the other:



$$
\theta_{min} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
$$



where $D$ is the aperture diameter.

## Mathematical Description

In the Fraunhofer regime, the electric field $U(x', y')$ in the observation plane is:



$$
U(x', y') \propto \iint A(x, y) \, e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{\lambda z}(x x' + y y')} \, dx \, dy
$$



This is a 2D Fourier transform evaluated at spatial frequencies $f_x = x'/\lambda z$, $f_y = y'/\lambda z$.
