## Definition

The *impulse response* of a linear system is the output of the system when the input is a [delta function](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/dirac_delta_function/) (impulse). For a linear operator $\mathcal{L}$, the impulse response $h(x; x_0)$ is defined by:



$$
\mathcal{L}\{\delta(x - x_0)\} = h(x; x_0)
$$



where $h(x; x_0)$ is the response at position $x$ due to an impulse at position $x_0$.

## Remarks

- The impulse response completely characterizes a linear system.
- For **shift-invariant** systems, $h(x; x_0) = h(x - x_0)$, and the system depends only on the relative displacement.
- In optics, the impulse response is called the [point_spread_function](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/point_spread_function/).
- In PDEs, the impulse response is called the **Green's function**.

## Superposition Integral

Any input can be expressed as a weighted sum of impulses. By [superposition](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/superposition/), the output is:



$$
g(x) = \int f(x_0) \, h(x; x_0) \, dx_0
$$



For shift-invariant systems, this becomes the [convolution integral](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/convolution/):



$$
g(x) = \int f(x_0) \, h(x - x_0) \, dx_0 = f(x) * h(x)
$$
