The **sinc function** is a fundamental function in signal processing and Fourier analysis. It arises naturally as the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) of a rectangular pulse.

## Definition

The **normalized sinc** function (used in signal processing):



$$
\text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}
$$



with $\text{sinc}(0) = 1$ by L'Hôpital's rule.

The **unnormalized sinc** (used in mathematics):



$$
\text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
$$



## Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| $\text{sinc}(0)$ | 1 |
| $\text{sinc}(n)$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$ | 0 |
| $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \text{sinc}(x) \, dx$ | 1 |
| $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \text{sinc}^2(x) \, dx$ | 1 |

## Fourier Transform Pair

The sinc and rect functions form a fundamental transform pair:



$$
\mathcal{F}\{\text{rect}(t)\} = \text{sinc}(f)
$$




$$
\mathcal{F}\{\text{sinc}(t)\} = \text{rect}(f)
$$



## Role in Sampling Theory

The sinc function is the **ideal interpolation kernel** for bandlimited signals. The [Whittaker-Shannon sampling theorem](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/whittaker-shannon_sampling_theorem/) states that a bandlimited signal can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples using sinc interpolation:



$$
x(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] \, \text{sinc}\left(\frac{t - nT}{T}\right)
$$



## In Optics

The sinc² intensity pattern appears in [Fraunhofer diffraction](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/fraunhofer_diffraction/) from a rectangular slit. The zeros of sinc determine the positions of dark fringes.
