The **DC component** (from "direct current") is the zero-frequency component of a signal — its average value or constant offset.

## Definition

For a signal $g(x)$, the DC component is:



$$
g_{DC} = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} g(x) \, dx
$$



In terms of the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/), the DC component is the value at zero frequency:



$$
G(0) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x) \, dx
$$



## Why "DC"?

The term comes from electrical engineering:
- **DC (Direct Current)**: Constant, non-oscillating current
- **AC (Alternating Current)**: Oscillating current with non-zero frequency

By analogy, the "DC component" of any signal is the part that doesn't oscillate — the constant offset.

## Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Frequency | $f = 0$ |
| Period | Infinite (no oscillation) |
| Value | Average of the signal |
| In spectrum | Located at the origin |

## Examples

1. **$g(x) = 3 + \cos(2\pi x)$**: DC component is 3 (the constant offset)
2. **$g(x) = \sin(x)$**: DC component is 0 (averages to zero)
3. **$g(x) = \text{rect}(x)$**: DC component equals the area of the rectangle

## In 2D

For a 2D function $g(x, y)$:



$$
G(0, 0) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x, y) \, dx \, dy
$$



The DC component is the total "volume" under the surface.

## Applications

- **Image processing**: The DC component is the average brightness of an image
- **Signal processing**: Removing the DC component centers a signal around zero
- **Power systems**: DC offset in AC signals can indicate faults
