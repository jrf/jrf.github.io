**Sampling** is the process of converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal by measuring its value at regular intervals.

## Mathematical Model

Ideal sampling multiplies the continuous signal $x(t)$ by a **[Dirac comb](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/dirac_comb/)**:



$$
x_s(t) = x(t) \cdot \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t - nT_s)
$$



where $T_s$ is the sampling period and $f_s = 1/T_s$ is the sampling frequency.

## Effect in Frequency Domain

Sampling causes the spectrum to become periodic (replicated at multiples of $f_s$):



$$
X_s(f) = \frac{1}{T_s} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} X(f - k f_s)
$$



## Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem

A bandlimited signal with maximum frequency $f_{max}$ can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if:



$$
f_s > 2 f_{max}
$$



The minimum sampling rate $2 f_{max}$ is called the **Nyquist rate**.

See: [Whittaker-Shannon sampling theorem](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/whittaker-shannon_sampling_theorem/)

## Aliasing

When $f_s < 2 f_{max}$, the replicated spectra overlap. High frequencies "fold back" and appear as lower frequencies — this is **aliasing**.

Aliasing cannot be corrected after sampling. Prevention requires:
1. **Anti-aliasing filter**: Low-pass filter before sampling
2. **Oversampling**: Sample faster than strictly necessary

## Reconstruction

Ideal reconstruction uses a low-pass filter (sinc interpolation):



$$
x(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] \, \text{sinc}\left(\frac{t - nT_s}{T_s}\right)
$$



See: [Sinc function](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/sinc_function/)

## Practical Considerations

- Real signals are never perfectly bandlimited
- Anti-aliasing filters have finite rolloff
- Reconstruction filters are causal approximations
- Quantization adds another source of error
