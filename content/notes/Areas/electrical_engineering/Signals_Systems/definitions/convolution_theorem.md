The **convolution theorem** states that [convolution](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/convolution/) in one domain corresponds to multiplication in the other domain under the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/).

## Statement

For functions $f$ and $g$ with Fourier transforms $F$ and $G$:



$$
\mathcal{F}\{f * g\} = F \cdot G
$$



Equivalently (by duality):



$$
\mathcal{F}\{f \cdot g\} = F * G
$$



## Proof Sketch

Starting from the definition of convolution:



$$
(f * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) g(t - \tau) \, d\tau
$$



Taking the Fourier transform of both sides and using the shift property of the Fourier transform leads to the product of transforms.

## Why It Matters

The convolution theorem is one of the most powerful results in signal processing because:

1. **Computational efficiency**: Convolution in the time domain is $O(N^2)$; multiplication in frequency domain is $O(N)$. Using FFT, the overall cost becomes $O(N \log N)$.

2. **System analysis**: For a [linear shift-invariant (LSI) system](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/linear_shift-invariant_system/) with [impulse response](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/impulse_response/) $h(t)$:
   - Output = Input * Impulse response: $y(t) = x(t) * h(t)$
   - In frequency domain: $Y(f) = X(f) \cdot H(f)$

   The [transfer function](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/transfer_function/) $H(f)$ completely characterizes the system.

3. **Filter design**: Design filters by specifying frequency response, then inverse transform.

## Applications

- **Fast convolution**: FFT-based convolution for large signals
- **Image processing**: Blurring, sharpening, edge detection
- **Spectral analysis**: Understanding how filtering affects frequency content
- **Deconvolution**: Recovering signals from blurred measurements
