## Definition

The *point spread function* (PSF) is the response of an imaging system to a point source. It is the optical equivalent of the [impulse_response](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/impulse_response/) in systems theory.

For an imaging operator $\mathcal{L}$, the point spread function $h(x; x_0)$ is:



$$
\mathcal{L}\{\delta(x - x_0)\} = h(x; x_0)
$$



where $\delta(x - x_0)$ represents a point source at position $x_0$.

## Physical Interpretation

- The PSF describes how a single point of light is "spread out" by the imaging system.
- A perfect imaging system would have $h(x; x_0) = \delta(x - x_0)$ (no spreading).
- Real systems have finite-width PSFs due to diffraction, aberrations, or defocus.

## Shift-Invariant Systems

For shift-invariant (isoplanatic) systems, the PSF depends only on relative position:



$$
h(x; x_0) = h(x - x_0)
$$



The image $g(x)$ of an object $f(x)$ is then given by [convolution](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/convolution/):



$$
g(x) = f(x) * h(x) = \int f(x_0) \, h(x - x_0) \, dx_0
$$



## Examples of Shift-Invariant Effects

- Diffraction
- Defocus (misfocusing)
- Spherical aberration

## Examples of Non-Shift-Invariant Effects

- Coma
- Astigmatism
- Distortion
