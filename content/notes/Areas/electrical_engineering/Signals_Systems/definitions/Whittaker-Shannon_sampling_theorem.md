The **Whittaker-Shannon [sampling](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/sampling/) theorem** (also known as the **Nyquist-Shannon [sampling](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/sampling/) theorem**) establishes the conditions under which a continuous band-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed from discrete samples.

## One-Dimensional Statement

A signal $g(t)$ that is band-limited to frequencies below $B$ Hz can be perfectly reconstructed from samples taken at rate $f_s$ if and only if:



$$
f_s \geq 2B
$$



The minimum [sampling](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/sampling/) rate $f_s = 2B$ is called the **Nyquist rate**.

## Two-Dimensional Statement

For a two-dimensional function $g(x, y)$ band-limited to $|f_x| \leq B_x$ and $|f_y| \leq B_y$, [sampling](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/sampling/) on a rectangular grid with spacings $X$ and $Y$ allows perfect reconstruction if:



$$
X \leq \frac{1}{2B_x}, \qquad Y \leq \frac{1}{2B_y}
$$



## Reconstruction Formula

The continuous signal can be reconstructed from samples $g(nX, mY)$ using:



$$
g(x, y) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} g(nX, mY) \, \mathrm{sinc}\left(\frac{x - nX}{X}\right) \mathrm{sinc}\left(\frac{y - mY}{Y}\right)
$$



where $\mathrm{sinc}(u) = \frac{\sin(\pi u)}{\pi u}$.

## Aliasing

When the [sampling](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/sampling/) conditions are violated (undersampling), spectral replicas overlap in the frequency domain. This phenomenon is called **aliasing** and causes irreversible distortion that prevents perfect reconstruction.

## Historical Note

The theorem is attributed to E.T. Whittaker (1915), V.A. Kotelnikov (1933), and C.E. Shannon (1949), who independently developed versions of this result.
