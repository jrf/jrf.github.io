The **transfer function** of a linear, shift-[invariant](/notes/areas/mathematics/abstract_algebra/definitions/invariant/) system characterizes the system's response in the frequency domain.

## Definition

For a system with [impulse response](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/impulse_response/) $h(x, y)$, the transfer function $H(f_x, f_y)$ is the [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) of the [impulse response](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/impulse_response/):



$$
H(f_x, f_y) = \iint_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(x, y) \, e^{-j2\pi(f_x x + f_y y)} \, dx \, dy
$$



## Input-Output Relationship

For an input $g_1(x, y)$ with [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/) $G_1(f_x, f_y)$, the output $g_2(x, y)$ has [Fourier transform](/notes/areas/mathematics/functional_analysis/definitions/fourier_transform/):



$$
G_2(f_x, f_y) = H(f_x, f_y) \cdot G_1(f_x, f_y)
$$



This follows from the [convolution theorem](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/signals_systems/definitions/convolution_theorem/): multiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to [convolution](/notes/areas/mathematics/real_analysis/definitions/convolution/) in the spatial domain.

## Properties

- **Magnitude** $|H(f_x, f_y)|$: describes amplitude scaling at each frequency
- **Phase** $\arg H(f_x, f_y)$: describes phase shift at each frequency
- A system is **stable** if the transfer function is bounded

## Optical Transfer Function (OTF)

In optics, the transfer function of an imaging system is called the **[Optical Transfer Function](/notes/areas/electrical_engineering/physical_optics/definitions/optical_transfer_function/)**. Its magnitude is the **Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)**, and its phase is the **Phase Transfer Function (PTF)**.
